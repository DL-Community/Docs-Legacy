# Settings

> - The following options are not available on all platforms. Please refer to the actual in-game version for specifics.
> - Click the menu icon in the lower right corner of the game's main interface to access the settings.

!> **Note**<br>
In the following text, macOS and iOS on Mac refer to different platforms respectively.<br>
The former is the macOS desktop version, while the latter is the iOS version running on Mac computers with M-series chips.

## Language
- Change the display language of the game.
- For details, please refer to [Localizations](/en/about/localization.md).

## Synchronization
!> It is **not recommended** to enable multiple automatic adjustments below simultaneously, as doing so may lead to **excessive synchronization correction**.

<!-- tabs:start -->

### **Auto Adjustment**
- When this option is enabled, the game will **dynamically adjust synchronization based on the overall performance during gameplay**.
- When the automatic adjustment feature is disabled, players can **manually adjust the audio delay in the game**. **A larger value results in later audio playback**.

### **Audio Output Latency**
- When enabled, the game will automatically detect and correct audio output latency. It is recommended to enable this when using Bluetooth headphones or car audio systems.

### **Touch Input Latency**
> **Applies to**<br>iOS.
- When enabled, the game will automatically detect and correct touch response latency. This option can be disabled to reduce CPU usage by the game.

<!-- tabs:end -->

### In-Level Synchronization
- After loading into any level, enter the synchronization settings. This configuration only applies to the current level.

## Sound
- Global sound switch for the game.

## Quality
- Adjusts the **scene/visual complexity and quality** in the game.

## Display Mode

<!-- tabs:start -->
### **Windows**

| Mode                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Exclusive Fullscreen | The game **exclusively occupies GPU resources**. The desktop is suspended, providing optimal performance, but switching between the game and the desktop is slower.                        |
| Borderless Window    | **Hides window borders and stretches the game to full screen proportionally**. Fast window switching speed, with GPU resources shared with the desktop.                                    |
| Windowed             | Windowed mode. **Window borders are not hidden, and the game is not stretched proportionally to full screen**. Fastest window switching speed, with GPU resources shared with the desktop. |

### **macOS**

| Mode              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Borderless Window | The game enters macOS full-screen mode.                                                                                                                                                    |

- Choose the Anti-Aliasing (AA) mode

| Mode                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Off                   | No Anti-aliasing                                                                                                                                                               |
| Multisample AA（MSAA）        | Hardware-level anti-aliasing method. Best results but low efficiency. Unavailable in some levels using deferred rendering (e.g., The Samurai (HD), The Apocalypse, The Adventure, The Memories, The Firework Paradise, etc.)                                                                                                      |
| Fast Approximate AA（FXAA）        | An anti-aliasing method based on post-processing of the screen, calculating the average value based on adjacent pixels. The effect is slightly inferior, resulting in a blurry image.                                                                                                                             |
| Subpixel Morphological AA（SMAA）         | An anti-aliasing based on screen post-processing that identifies and eliminates aliasing by analyzing edge and color information in an image. It offers a relatively balanced performance in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.                                                                                                                   |
